## 👋 Hello there!

My name is Ryan, and I'm a software developer located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
I have been working with computers all my life, from getting my first computer, a used Apple II Plus from my elementary school tech sale, to the present day, where I have my own home lab running virtual environments. I have always been fascinated by how computers work and how you can make them do cool things.

I started my tech career in the telecommunications industry, installing and configuring cellular network equipment.
I wanted to expand my knowledge, so I got a diploma in Programming from **[NAIT](https://nait.ca)** (My local tech college).
I started my professional programming career in 2014.
My work experience has mostly been in the Microsoft tech stack (WFP, WinForms, ASP.NET, MS SQL, etc.) using languages like C# and VB.NET.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

Over the past couple of years, I have wanted to diversify my tech exposure and learn some of the more popular technologies I see on exciting job posts. 
This desire has led me on a learning journey as follows:

- **[Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/)**: Full-Stack Engineer (2025 - 2026) :white_check_mark:
  - React, Express, Typescript/JavaScript
  - Postgres SQL, Open API
  - Unix CLI, GIT
- **[Boot.dev](https://Boot.dev/)**: Back-end Developer Path (2025 - In progress)
  - Python, Go, C
  - Unix CLI, GIT

- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)**: 75 Essential / Trending interview problems (2025 - In progress)
  - Tech interview prep

Through my travels on this learning journey, I've come across additional courses and resources that I think would be beneficial to learn:

- **[Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/)**:
  - Data structures and algorithms
  - Systems Design
  - Tech interview prep
- **[Codecrafters](https://codecrafters.io/)**:
  - Project challenges in various languages
- **[Low Level Academy](https://lowlevel.academy/)**:
  - Low-level programming in C and Rust
 

## :stars: My goals for 2026 and beyond

  - Complete the Boot.dev: Back-end Developer Path by the end of 2026
  - Apply for programming jobs that utilize the technologies I have been learning
  - Continue interview prep with LeetCode & NeetCode
  - Expand my portfolio of projects with challenges from Codecrafters
  - Begin development on an emulator (Thinking NES?)
